# gopatterns

Concurrency patterns in Go inspired by [O'Reilly Chapter 4. Concurrency Patterns in Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-in-go/9781491941294/ch04.html) with generics.

I don't plan to maintain this repo or do anything with it. Don't use it in production :upside_down_face:
